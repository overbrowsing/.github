# Overbrowsing

Overbrowsing is an applied research group focused on advancing sustainable web practices. Established as part of doctoral research at The University of Edinburgh’s Department of [Design Informatics](https://www.designinformatics.org), we blend inquiry with action to develop research-driven solutions that reduce environmental impact, enhance accessibility, and align technological potential with environmental stewardship.

The terms “browsing” the web and “browser” share an origin in herbivory, where herbivores feed on vegetation. In nature, “overbrowsing” occurs when overconsumption and overpopulation exert extreme pressure on the environment. This shared origin parallels the unsustainable excesses of the web, aligning with the group’s mission.
