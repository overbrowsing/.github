# Overbrowsing

Overbrowsing is an applied research group committed to advancing sustainable web design practices. Established as part of doctoral research at the Department of [Design Informatics](https://www.designinformatics.org) at the University of Edinburgh, we blend inquiry and action to promote resource optimisation, ethical design, and strategies that balance technology’s potential with environmental stewardship.

The term ‘browsing’ originates from herbivores grazing, Similarly, ‘[overbrowsing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browsing_(herbivory)#Overbrowsing)’ describes excessive grazing harming ecosystems, it serves as a metaphor for the unsustainable excesses of web usage. This shared origin aligns with the initiative’s core mission.
