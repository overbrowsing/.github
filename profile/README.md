# Overbrowsing

Overbrowsing is an applied research group focused on advancing sustainable web practices. Established as part of doctoral research at The University of Edinburgh's Institute for Design Informatics, we blend inquiry with action to develop research-driven solutions that reduce the environmental impact of the internet and improve accessibility, aligning technological potential with environmental stewardship.

The term “browsing” originates from herbivores feeding, and similarly, “overbrowsing” in nature occurs when consumption exceeds the capacity of environmental resources. This shared origin parallels the unsustainable excesses of the web, aligning with the group’s mission.
